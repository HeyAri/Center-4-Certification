# Center-4-Certification
The items that I'd like to do:
- Fix Footer on certificate. It floats to the top and blocks the certificate from being viewed.
- I've been getting a lot of spam certifications because the email field accepts " " as valid. I found a possible solution here... https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19605773/html5-email-validation 
It doesn't need to be real validation, just not accept spaces as valid
- I found a possible solution for adding a pdf download of the certificate here... https://prittytimes.com/save-the-particular-div-in-pdf-format-onclick-using-jquery/
looks like it might be about the simplest way?
